# NewsAPI-Clean-Architecture-MVVM-Kotlin

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Androidâ€™s modern architecture components within a robust, testable, and maintainable application using a clean architecture MVVM pattern in Kotlin. The app fetches the latest news headlines from NewsAPI, illustrating best practices in modular design, data flow, and system UI handling including edge-to-edge layouts.

## Let's Explore Architecture Components

According to [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture), Architecture Components are a set of Android libraries that help you structure apps for scalability, testability, and maintainability. This project leverages:

- **Jetpack Compose** for modern UI implementation.
- **Hilt** for dependency injection.
- **ViewModel** and **LiveData/StateFlow** to preserve and manage UI state.
- **Room** (optional, for caching and persistence).
- **Retrofit** and **OkHttp** for network access.
- **Coroutines/Flow** for asynchronous programming.

## Why MVVM?

- **ViewModels** have built-in lifecycle awareness.
- **ViewModel** doesnâ€™t reference UI views directly, avoiding memory leaks.
- Decoupling allows UI to simply observe data changes.
- **ViewModel** survives configuration changes, saving/restoring UI state.

## MVVM Best Practices

- Avoid UI references in ViewModels for a cleaner separation.
- Allow the UI to observe data from ViewModels instead of receiving pushed updates.
- Distribute responsibilities: Add a domain layer for business logic if needed.
- Implement a repository as the single entry for all data operations.
- Expose data state using a sealed wrapper, such as `ApiResult`, for error/loading handling.
- Think about edge cases, like long-running tasks and memory leaks.

## LiveData & State Management

- Use `LiveData` or `StateFlow` in ViewModels to expose data and UI events.
- Keep LiveData for UI-binding events isolated to ViewModel, while data-emitting streams should originate in data/domain layers.

## Coroutines

- Coroutines provide sequential, asynchronous code thatâ€™s easier to reason about than traditional callbacks or threads.
- Creating coroutines is lightweight compared to full threads.
- Favor simple coroutine-based flows over more complex observable patterns when not needed.
- Parent coroutines in ViewModels manage the lifecycle of child coroutines, avoiding leaks.

## Jetpack Compose

- Implements Jetpack Compose for building a modern, declarative UI with less boilerplate.
- All screens and UI components (lists, cards, details, navigation) are built with Compose best practices.
- Integrates Compose state management alongside ViewModel and flows, enabling reactive UIs.
- Demonstrates clean separation between UI and logic, leveraging Composeâ€™s composable functions for reusable and maintainable interface code.
- Makes it easy to update and scale UI elements without a traditional XML layout.
